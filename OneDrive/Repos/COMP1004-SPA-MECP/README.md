# 2021-COMP1004-SPA

This is a README file for my COMP1004 Mount Edgcumbe Country Park SPA.

## Intro

Throughout this file, you will be briefed on how the project works including:

* How to run the site!
* Development phases!

## Site Information

The Friends of Mount Edgcumbe Country Park are looking for an interactive map that showcases areas of the map where walkers will see or want to visit,
and it will give information of the area they are in.

</p>

Upon loading the site you will be greeted by a welcome message that tells you whether it is the morning, afternoon or evening and whether the map is open or closed.
Underneath the header you will see a navbar pannel, a google map pane, and images displaying what the area looks like, if you tap on the buttons on the left side of the screen, it
will navigate you through the park. Each button displays text about the location as well. 

In hopes to raise money for the park, I've added a donation button and a membership redirect forum on "Become a Friend".
